    <h>Jobs</h>
    
    <p></p>
    <h>Applications Developer</h>
    <p></p>
    <h> Profile: </h>
    <p>Responsibility: Employed by the client to carry out their client specifications, which they would do through
      conversations with the client through meetings, understanding what the main role of the program is in order for
      it to perform correctly. </p>
    <p>Skills and Tasks Involved: Being able to problem solve is important in this job as correcting issues is
      necessary in order to be effective at the job, however, being able to predict future problems and prevent them is
      an ability very valuable to an employee. Working as part of a team in order to complete large projects, therefore
      being able to work in a group is also essential. </p>
    <p>The job requires you to be able to break down program specifications so that it can then become programmable
      language, so that when creating the application, the broken-down form allows greater control over the both the
      outcome of the tests and better designs of the program, increasing its effectiveness. Being an application
      developer requires you to learn new ways and maintain the skill and knowledge by using material like manuals and
      technical reports in order to remain effective at your job, the same applies for the equipment that you will use,
      constant maintenance and improvements must be made to prevent you and your work becoming obsolete.</p>
    <p>Salary: Starting around £20,000 as a graduate, with further experience becoming established within the job, the
      salary would increase, ranging between £34,000 - £40,000. However, the highest salaries possible in this job can
      exceed £50,000 a year. </p>
      <img src= "images/code.jpg" alt="code on screen">
    <p>Working Hours: Like a traditional job, the work hours consist of a 9-5, however, the job may require you to work
      extra hours in order to meet deadlines for projects. </p>
    <p>What to expect:
      Even though the job is typically carried out in office environments, the job does allow for remote working
      meaning work can be carried outside of the office. Additionally, this job is available around the country and
      with further experience, becoming self-employed through contracting is possible. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, the job is male-dominated, however, steps are being taken in order to balance out the
      one-sidedness. Moreover, a high level of commitment is required due to the high-workload and the stress produced
      through the need of projects being completed on time. Additionally, travelling during the day means time away
      from home especially when working overseas.</p>
    <h>Games Developer</h>
    <p></p>
    <h>Profile: </h>
    <p>Responsibility:</p>
    <p>The job entails producing a game for the company you’re employed by bringing the designer’s imagination to life
      or be involved yourself with bringing your own design to life. </p>
    <p>Skills and Tasks Involved: As C++ and C# are high quality code, they would need to be used to design, develop
      and deliver systems. Moreover, reviewing the performance of your code is necessary in order to improve the design
      of existing code. This would be done through testing for problems like bugs, the job would then require you to
      record precisely were the problem was discovered then solved, this must be done systematically so to guarantee
      quality production.</p>
    <p>Like the application developer role, this job also requires you to work in a group so that the demands can be
      met, however individually, you must be able to work effectively under pressure in order to stay on top of the
      workloads. </p>
    <p>Salary:
      Compared to Application Developer, the job starts off lower at £19,000 per year however ranges up to £25,000
      annually. However, the increased experience would correlate with your salary, for example with a few years of
      experience, your salary could double, possibly earn between £35,000 or £50,000. At the top level (senior
      position: team leader) you could possibly earn between £55,000 to above £75,000 a year. </p>
    <p>However, the salaries depend on your role and experience as well as the company you work, for example some
      companies offer bonuses or a profit-sharing scheme. </p>
    <p>Working Hours:
      This offers a more flexibility over a 40-hour week, as the role doesn’t make it necessary for you to work 9-5.
      However, like an Application Developer, the role may require you to work extra hours in order to complete tasks
      on time.</p>
    <p>What to expect:
      If you’re looking for a job that doesn’t require you to work in a formal environment, then this is the job you
      are looking, since at the lower levels of the job client contact will be minimal so it wouldn’t require you to be
      formal as much as someone who is more involved with the client. </p>
    <p>Similarly, the job can allow for the work to be carried outside of the usual means for example a free-lancer
      could work from home. However, typically the job would be based in a studio or office. Additionally, this role is
      available across the country. The job may require that you travel occasionally to meet clients, attend courses to
      improve and learn new skills or carry out research.</p>
    <p>Conclusion:
      These jobs are similar, both requiring the employee to work under pressure, in a team in roder to meet the
      demands of the project, to produce a piece of high-quality work under the pressure of a deadline. </p>
    <p>However, where the jobs differ is that a Games Developer has more creative control over what they produce as
      they can be independent from the client and work for company’s goals, where as an application developer would
      have to work according to the specification of the clients wishes. Additionally, the Games Developer at the
      senior level can earn more than an application developer at the same level, as well as have more flexibile hours
      over the week.</p>
