      <h>What should you expect? </h>
      <p>To all my readers reading the First Response, prepare yourself for the latest news on the exploration on web
        development, including the different components incorporated in web development which will all be defined in
        the glossary, within this site.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, expect job comparisons for anyone considering going into the computing industry. As well as
        popular reviews on current web-based topics and resources, and do not, if you are on the hunt to improve your
        computing skills and widening your knowledge as computing scientists, tutorials from YouTube that cover web
        development techniques are also incorporated into the site.</p>
      <p>This website provides and showcases the fundamental knowledge of web development. All this information, like a
        newspaper, will be provided within a column-based layout.</p>

  <article class="overview">
    <h>Purpose of the Site</h>
    <p>This newspaper-based website was created as part of my assignment for web development for my first term at
      university, to showcase everything I have learned, that I both struggled and achieved as part of my module in
      computing. For the user, this site was created to be responsive so that not only can it be used on desktop
      devices but also mobile devices.</p>
    <p>This assignment, despite its difficulty from my lack of skill and knowledge, was my favourite one I have
      received from all my assignments, I have spent most of my time reading what I can about it since I have always
      been
      curious about how websites, games and other web resources are created.</p>
    <h>More details about the author</h>
    <p>My name is Gomes and I was born in Liverpool but now reside in Coventry. The reason why I chose to come to
      Northampton was because I wanted to stay in education after sixth form but did not want to go too far away from
      home, Northampton offered the means for me to study as well as carry on playing basketball since I am an avid fan
      of basketball. Because of my time playing basketball, I have learned to love challenges and knowing that if I do
      put in work I will see results regardless of if I don’t go where I want to go, I’ll be satisfied with knowing my
      skill has improved.</p>
    <p>This is relevant because I have no experience with coding in java nor in web development so for me at my
      position,
      I had to and still must remain dedicated to my work because I am already set at a disadvantage. Like I have
      mentioned before I have always been curious about how websites, games and other web resources are created, my dad
      who has a computing degree also inspired me to do this course as, he hass told me I could go far if I use remain
      dedicated in this course. From my time completing my assignment, already I have enjoyed continuously learning new
      things which was one element of why I have remained motivated to stay on the course despite its difficulty right
      at the beginning. </p>
    <h>What is Web development?</h>
    <p>Web development is the creation of programs or applications that are used in the internet. A web developer would
      therefore need to be able to create these resources. We will go deeper on this in the Jobs section looking at the
      skills needed specifically for this position.</p>
