    <p><em>"A good framework for responsive, modern and fast design of websites"</p></em>
    <h>What do you like best?</h>
    <p><em>"It is a good framework if you want to develop websites that are responsive quickly and effectively. To be
        able to apply it only to use the boostrap's own classes and the web is stamped in a nonsense.
        Bootstrap does not require any type of installation on the server or the computer, just include the bootstrap
        libraries in your project and it can already be used. Being a very extensive framework, there is a large
        support community that can help you if you have a problem with the implementation of its components". </p></em>
    <h>What do you dislike? </h>
    <p><em>"The bootstrap components are pretty basic, if you want to make a website with very special features and
        very
        specific features you have to look for life to do it, as it includes it.
        The bookstores should be placed within the code in the manner indicated in the bootstrap documentation but may
        have problems to work correctly. Websites may take a while to load."</p></em>
    <h>Recommendations to others considering the product </h>
    <p><em>"I highly recommend all the professionals who need to make the front-end of the webs quickly, responsive and
        with a very visual and pleasant design".</p></em>
    <h>What business problems are you solving with the product? What benefits have you realized?</h>
    <em>
      <p>"I use it to design web pages responsive because it allows me to develop websites very quickly and that are
        very good. Customers ask for this type of framework because it is very visual and adapts to all types of
        devices".</p>
